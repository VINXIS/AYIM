He made his debut in 2016 with two guest difficulties on \"Cory in the House\", and he has surely stepped up to meet today's standards, making his way into the ranked section this year with maps such as \"Harmonize Clover\" and a fantastic guest difficulty on the Pendulum track \"Showdown\", which makes use of potentially controversial yet interesting 1/8 patterning choices. Definitely check his Loved map \"minefield surfing\", since it's one of the most interesting Loved maps I've seen in a long time."},{"username":"qoot8123","userId":766371,"isRookie":"FALSE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"A true veteran of osu!taiko, qoot returned to the BNG this year and proved to be up to nowadays' standards.

On a more serious note, his departure from the BNG was a great loss for the mode. Widely known for his famous dedication to metal songs (a shared trait with me, ho!), as well as high proficiency in the timing field, not to forget the incredibly useful mapping tool (https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/673325) that made all of our lives easier, his contributions to the mode are in no way forgettable. He still managed to push forward to rank some outstanding maps such as \"Angel Vivaldi - A Mercurian Summer\" and \"Rings of Saturn - The macrocosm\", both of which show very characteristic patterns from his mapping style. Make sure to check them out if you'd like a high level challenge!"},{"username":"Raphalge","userId":3918650,"isRookie":"FALSE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"A kind and trustworthy Swedish dude who is also a godlike HR player. I have to admit that I was honestly shocked the first time I saw him mapping. This guy quickly adapted to how mapping works and showed it in his first ranked map (I ranked it myself) in 2017. This year he showed his proficiency again with a fantastic song \"Astral Dogma\" from Yousei Teikoku. While both of these maps are marathons, I'm sure he could map a full spread as well as mod one. I wouldn't mind at all to see him become more invested in mapping and modding and trying to join the Beatmap Nominators."},{"username":"-Sh1n1-","userId":1957638,"isRookie":"FALSE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"An old friend of mine who finally managed to get into the BNG. He's fairly known for having a certain degree of multi-mode proficiency, and while he's not an osu!taiko BN, I would certainly not mind having him aboard. His knowledge of several modes (but most importantly, osu!taiko, obviously!) and his great capabilities at pushing solid mapsets to rank from various genres make him a great asset to the community. Keep it up!"},{"username":"Greenshell","userId":8693851,"isRookie":"TRUE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"During my tenure as a QAT so far, there are certain people who have made me feel anything but indifferent. Most of them are incredible people who have shown very promising skills and attitude, and Greenshell is one of those people today. Not many people have dedicated this much time to improve themselves, not only on this game or mode, but also personally. While unfortunately he has not had the chance to join the BNG yet (he is now a BN, ha!), I'm sure he will be able to soon enough, as his modding and mapping skill, paired with his mostly impeccable attitude (and his love of red pandas, of course) make him a most suitable candidate. This year, he's managed to push to rank one of my favourite mapsets of the year, \"Sayonara Planet Wars\", which shows how a spread is actually supposed to be created as well as having an incredibly well built top difficulty which squeezes every last musical element from the song. All in all, Greenshell is a healthy and desirable presence in any kind of community, and we are lucky to have him. Keep it up, boy."},{"username":"_DUSK_","userId":6092181,"isRookie":"TRUE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"I remember getting to know him waaay back in at least 2015 when I had just gotten into the BNG. His enthusiasm in the mode fascinated me quite a bit for a 13 year old. Now he's all grown up, having gained enough maturity as well as fantastic mapping and modding (and playing!) skills at taiko. Each and every one of his ranked mapsets were ranked this year, so I expect lots of things from this guy in the coming years!"},{"username":"ARGENTINE DREAM","userId":1981781,"isRookie":"TRUE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"I'd be lying if I said that she is not one of my closest osu! pals. DREAM (now _WWWWWW_WWWWWW_) has clearly shown her profound interest in the game mode, especially after the takedown on Ishukan Communication. Having so many years of music studies and TnT behind her back, it surely was not a big deal for her to quickly and firmly grasp the concepts of osu!taiko mapping, ensuring an astoundingly rapid ascension to the top tier of mappers and modders as well as her position among the Beatmap Nominators. By far, the map I like the most from her this year is, without any kind of a doubt, \"An Elegy Of Icaros\", a black metal song that is beautifully mapped (and is also spotlighted in last year's Autumn Spotlights, check it out!). All in all, one of the, if not the most promising individual in our community from my perspective."},{"username":"Okoratu","userId":1623405,"isRookie":"FALSE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"It is Wednesday, my dudes. Nothing defines Okoratu/Okorin/Okoyue/Okowhatever better than this catchphrase. I'm writing this comment on a Wednesday, too. Now for the serious part: Okoratu is... strange. There is no adjective that I can actually think of to fully define him, but this only makes him more interesting as a person and as a community member. His presence in taiko has mostly been via sporadic appearances to either rank something (he can nominate taiko, yes) or to get something ranked himself, but this does not mean he has not spent much time in this mode. He has actually contributed greatly to the discussion on the initial rework of the RC as well as the continued updates. This year, he's pushed to rank a huge hybrid set \"Gabriel Drop Kick\", which features a total of 20 difficulties, 5 of which are for taiko. You seriously need some patience for that. I hope these comments come out also on a Wednesday."},{"username":"Kuron-kun","userId":2697284,"isRookie":"FALSE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"Kuron is no stranger to taiko. At least, not any longer, as he managed to push two maps forward this year: \"Placa no Chao\" and \"Natsuiro Egao de 1,2, Jump!\" One of the most renown names in the Brazilian community, and also an osu!standard QAT member, he has taken some of his time to properly learn how taiko works, and that is certainly admirable. I wish to see more from him in the future. P.S.: He's CUTE. AS. HELL."},{"username":"Mew104","userId":2345156,"isRookie":"FALSE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"Mew is fairly known among the community for being an incredibly good player and mapper, but also for being Weegee-eyed Mr. Krabs. His avatar is obviously his most well-known aspect. Jokes aside, this year he managed to push forward a map to rank (\"The Rift\"), and let me assure you that this is nothing short of a multi-rhythm masterpiece. Despite having only two ranked maps, he certainly is no stranger to the ranking process, and the amazing quality of his works do pay off in the end. Not only is it a fantastic set difficulty-wise, but the highest difficulty shows how perceptive his ears are as well as his capability of interpreting a plethora of various rhythms and smashing them together to create pieces of art. He ranked one map in 2017 and one in 2018. Can't wait for the 2019 one. \nP.S.: I only need 45 more for the Maw."},{"username":"Aloda","userId":1190127,"isRookie":"FALSE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"Our Australian QAT. His premature departure has certainly taken a toll on the team as he is, like Nardo, a very integral and reliable person. His impeccable attitude and outstanding modding capabilities are what made him a worthy addition for us. Lest we forget about his mapping in 2018, ho! This year, Aloda managed to push some maps to rank such as \"SOSOSO - Try for Keeps\", a very solid vocaloid mapset. I wish you luck in your future endeavours, and I also want to thank you dearly for the service you have provided to this mode. It will not be forgotten."},{"username":"hikiko-","userId":6512678,"isRookie":"FALSE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"The one-handed osu!taiko player. That, by itself, should already tell you a lot.

The one and only Nardo. Having had the chance to work alongside him for more than a year now, I can safely say that he is one of if not the most integral people I have ever met in this game. His profound work ethic and impressive discipline is something to be reckoned with. He has, this year, almost single handedly managed Quality Assurance on his own, checking almost if not every single map that went on to be qualified. Not many people can do that consistently while simultaneously pushing a handful of their own maps to rank and managing a real life job at the same time. But Nardo can, and I certainly am grateful that he exists. I look forward to continue working with him for as long as possible, and would certainly not mind meeting him in real life at all! One of my favourite maps from him this year is \"EPICA - Universal Death Squad\", which is a symphonic metal masterpiece. You should definitely check it out!"},{"username":"Nwolf","userId":1910766,"isRookie":"FALSE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"What's there to say about Nwolf that hasn't been said already? Our good ol' German pal and ex-Beatmap Nominator (possibly returning soonâ„¢), he's both a good community member and a good person. He may have his occasional rants, but we still love him nonetheless. This year, he ranked one of the maps he had featured in the osu!taiko World Cup 2018: \"onoken - Viden\", which is a complex rhythm piece that uses a lot of off-beat patterns. Don't let the lack of mixed snaps fool you! The rhythm is already complex by itself!"},{"username":"Tyistiana","userId":1421452,"isRookie":"TRUE","commenter":"Raiden","comment":"While this sentiment may not be shared wikth many, I do have to recognize his potential. I remember seeing his mods for the BNG application, and all I could think was \"he needs a little push in the right direction!\". I highly value applicants like that, and especially if they keep trying very hard (he is now a BN, yes!). This guy certainly has an acute sense of what modding actually means, and I am fairly sure we will see him working as a nominator soon enough. We shouldn't forget the mapping part, too! Tyistiana has pushed to rank 2 solid mapsets, which means he is very aware of how ranking works.

Oh wait... \nWhile Lasse is not too widely known amongst osu!taiko community members, he has managed to push some maps to rank, most of them being solid anime sets with a decent spread.
